# Memory Game

Creating a simple JavaScript based memory game.

## Description

The project was a learning exercise on understanding JavaScript, through the guidance of an online tutorial. That was further expanded and customised.

## How To Play
 * The game consists of a 6 x 4 grid and the aim is to match all 12 characters hidden behind the ? blocks
 * For every incorrect match you make, you are given a 1.2 second delay to remember what the characters were, so you can try again and find a match
 * Once all matches have been made the game is complete
